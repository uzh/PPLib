      |<p>We are trying to better understand the costs of running power plants. To do so, we are asking you to do some thinking (maybe also some reading :) ).
      |We are comparing the following two power plants in this HIT: <br/>
      |<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Melones_Dam">New_Melones_Dam</a> and
      |<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss_Landing_Power_Plant">Moss_Landing_Power_Plant</a></p>
      |<p>The most 5 creative (and useful) answers for our HITâ€™s will be bonused $5. (Note, that we are looking for indirect/direct cost factors such as '<i>uranium disposal cost</i>' (more creative would be better), NOT the number)</p>
      |<p>Feel free to give multiple answers in this HIT, we will review all of them individually to nominate the winners.
      |Please collect all of your answers in one HIT and <b>do not submit more than one HIT of this type</b> (your 2nd, 3rd etc submission will be rejected, please submit only one per day of this type). You do not need to write something in each text field (just write 'nothing' where you have no idea), these are just to help you think of differences - completely empty / too trivial answers will be rejected though.</p>
