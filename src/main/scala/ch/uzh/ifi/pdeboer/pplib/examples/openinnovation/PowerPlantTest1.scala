      |<p>Imagine you are running a couple of power plants in the US, and you are deciding whether to build an additional power plant.
      |Assuming you already know the construction cost for the power plant, there are some ongoing cost that differ by power plant type (water, coal, solar..) and region (hot / cold, river/ocean close by etc).
      |In this HIT, we are trying to figure out ideas for <b>ongoing cost</b> that are to be expected (i.e. those that accumulate after building the plant) such that we can decide what type of plant to build, and where (by weighing different options).</p>
      |<p>The most 5 creative (and useful) answers for our HITâ€™s will be bonused $5.</p>
      |<p>Feel free to give multiple answers in this HIT, we will review all of them individually to nominate the winners.
      |Please collect all of your answers in one HIT and <b>do not submit more than one HIT of this type</b> (your 2nd, 3rd etc submission will be rejected, please submit only one per day of this type). You do not need to write something in each text field (just write 'nothing' where you have no idea), these are just to help you think of differences - completely empty / too trivial answers will be rejected though.</p>
